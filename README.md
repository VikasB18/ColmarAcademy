# Colmar Academy Landing Page

This project was completed as part of Codecademy's Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages Path. It serves as the capstone project where we applied our learning to build a responsive website from scratch. The goal was to create a landing page for a new school, Colmar Academy, using provided wireframes, videos, and image resources. All design decisions were made to complete the site, incorporating responsive design techniques and media queries to ensure compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices.
